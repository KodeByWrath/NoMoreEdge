### It isn’t working for me!

Make sure installed application using setup from latest release, then run `microsoft-edge:https://google.com` using the `Windows` + `R` keys. If that is properly redirected, [file a bug report!](https://github.com/HarshalKudale/NoMoreEdge/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)

### My search engine is still Google, I want something else.
